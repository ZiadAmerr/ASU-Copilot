The large language model might be based on the GPT architecture and is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. The text-to-image model is used to generate images from textual descriptions, while the image-to-text model is used to generate textual descriptions from images. The system can be used for a variety of tasks, such as generating personalized recommendations for students, generating visual aids for lectures, and assisting with image-based searches. Overall, ASU Copilot is designed to provide a more interactive and engaging learning experience for students, while improving the efficiency of content creation and search.
